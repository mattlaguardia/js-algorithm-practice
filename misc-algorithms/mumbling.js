// in this exersize you will need to do two iterations through the string to first see how many letters are in the string. will also need to use the split method to break it up into an array. then from each part of the array find the number and corrilate it with how many letters need to be created

// Sample input = "abcd"
// Sample output = "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"

function accum(s){
  var res = "";

  for(var i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    for(var j = 0; j <= i; j++){
      // need an if statement 
    }
  }

}
