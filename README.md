# js-algorithm-practice

This repo has JS answers to some algorithm questions. Try to build out algorithms before using a node and a text editor.

## Question 1: Check if a Prime Number
Question: How would you verify a prime number?

TODO: Create a function that checks to see if a number is prime or not.

Clue: A prime number is only divisible by itself and 1. You will need to use a while loop to keep iterating all the numbers until you get to the number we are checking.

## Question 2: How to Find All Prime Factors of a Number
Question: How could you find all prime factors of a number?

TODO: Create a function that has a while loop. The while loop will loop through numbers leading up to the inputted number. Checking to see if any of the dividing numbers are prime numbers, pushing the divisor number into an empty array if the number is prime.

Clue: Start dividing by two and if not divisible increase the divisor until you reach the inputted number.

## Question 3: Fibonacci Number
Question: How do you get nth Fibonacci number?

TODO: Create a function which returns the nth number in Fibonacci sequences with an input n. Fibonacci series is defined as f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Clue: Create an array and iterate through

Extra: Write out both the O(n) and recursive answers

## Question 4: Greatest Common divisor
Question: How would you find the greatest common divisor of two numbers?

TODO: Create a function which finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Clue: Use a while loop to loop through the divisors of the numbers until the two divisors matchup and must be the greatest number.

## Question 5: Removing Duplicate Numbers in an array
Question: How would you remove duplicate members from an array?

TODO: Build a function that checks numbers in an array

## Question 6: Mumbling
Question: Try and get output of a string to be as follows:
  input = "abcd"
  output = "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"

TODO: Build the function (hint iterate within an iteration)
