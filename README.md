# js-algorithm-practice

This repo has JS answers to some algorithm questions. Try to build out algorithms before using a node and a text editor.

## Question 1: Check if a Prime Number
Question: How would you verify a prime number?

TODO: Create a function that checks to see if a number is prime or not.

Clue: A prime number is only divisible by itself and 1. You will need to use a while loop to keep iterating all the numbers until you get to the number we are checking.

## Question 2: How to find all prime factors of a number
Question: How could you find all prime factors of a number?

TODO: Create a function that has a while loop. The while loop will loop through numbers leading up to the inputted number. Checking to see if any of the dividing numbers are prime numbers, pushing the divisor number into an empty array if the number is prime.

Clue: Start dividing by two and if not divisible increase the divisor until you reach the inputted number.
